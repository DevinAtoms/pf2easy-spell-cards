Once a dragon has used its breath Strike, it winks out of existence; when you have no dragons remaining, the spell ends.</p><h2>Draconic Barrage</h2><table class=\"pf2-table\"><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Dragon</th><th>Breath Strike type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Copper or Black</td><td>Acid</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Silver or White</td><td>Cold</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Bronze or Blue</td><td>Electricity</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Brass, Gold, or Red</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Green</td><td>Poison</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Your choice of dragon</td><td>As the dragon</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section class='content extra'><p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> You shape 1 additional dragon, and the Strike damage increases by 1d6.</p></section>"

This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li><li><strong>Oubliette (10th level only)</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Wish]{Wish}</em> can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Freedom]{Freedom}</em> ritual can do so.</li><li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li><li><strong>Slumber (sleep effect)</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target-whether romantically, filially, or otherwise-frees it from the slumber. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also enchantment magic.</li><li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends.

You can also make one attempt to Steal as part of Casting <em>umbral extraction</em>. If you succeed at your check to Steal a spell, you deal 1d4 mental damage to the target per level of the spell stolen due to the psychological toll of the spiritual emptiness created by wrenching the spell away, and you place the stolen spell in your temporary spell slot.

If the target has no spell slots of that level, use the highest level below that in which the target does have a spell slot. (If the target has no eligible spells, you get nothing, but you can continue to attempt to Steal spells for the remaining duration.) If the target is a prepared caster, you randomly steal one of their prepared spells. If the target is a spontaneous caster, you instead steal an unexpended spell slot of the appropriate level and determine the spell at random from all the target's known spells at that level. You can't steal a target's innate spells, focus spells, or cantrips. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it, and your temporary spell slot becomes a spell slot of the same level as the spell you stole.</p><p>As normal, you can Steal only from a target within your reach. Once you've placed a spell in your temporary spell slot, you can't attempt to Steal more spells. If you succeed at your Thievery check, you must take the spell you stole. Even if you're a spontaneous caster, you can use the temporary spell slot only to cast the stolen spell and you can cast only the stolen spell from your temporary spell slot. When <em>umbral extraction</em> ends, you lose the temporary spell slot and any spell still stored in it.

If you succeeded, but the spell's level was too high to steal automatically, you must attempt a counteract check to see if you steal the spell. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it. If you store it, you can transfer it to a willing creature as a single action that has the manipulate trait.

Each target can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to share what it sees with any number of other targets until the start of its next turn. Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision.</p><p>This improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at.

This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn't otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient's vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy.</p><p>Once the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends.

This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally-you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.</p><p><strong>Attacks</strong> Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal negative damage instead of their normal type.</p><p><strong>Strength</strong> Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength score you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks-typically Athletics checks-against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.</p><p><strong>Ties that Bind</strong> When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete. In this liminal state, you might come across strange energies and become another sort of creature, or anchor to a summoner and become an eidolon.</p></section>"

While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p><p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p><p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals [[/r {1d6}[bludgeoning]]]{1d6 bludgeoning damage} and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals [[/r {1d4}[bludgeoning]]]{1d4 bludgeoning damage} and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p><p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.6KciIDJV6ZdJcAVa]{Sterling Dynamo} archetype.</p></section>"
